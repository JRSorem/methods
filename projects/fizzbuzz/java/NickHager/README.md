-FIZZBUZZ-

A simple program that takes an integer (n) from a user and print from 1 to n in the console.
As the program prints, if a number is divisible by 3 or 5 then 'Fizz' or 'Buzz' is printed
instead, respectively. Both 'Fizz' and 'Buzz' may be printed at the same time for numbers that
are divisible by both.
